# Android Voice Echo App

This is an Android application developed as an assignment, demonstrating core functionalities of Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS).

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this application is to:
* Capture user's spoken input using Android's Speech Recognition API.
* Immediately echo back the recognized text using the Text-to-Speech engine.

## Current Status

**Core functionality (Speech-to-Text input and Text-to-Speech echo) is fully implemented and working.**

### Next Steps:
The next phase of development will focus on implementing a chat-style conversation view to display a history of spoken input and echoed responses, along with timestamps.

## Technologies Used

* Android SDK
* Java
* Android Speech Recognition API (`RecognizerIntent`)
* Android Text-to-Speech (TTS) API (`TextToSpeech`)

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AndroidVoiceEchoApp.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/AndroidVoiceEchoApp.git)
    ```
    (Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username)
2.  **Open in Android Studio:** Open the cloned project folder using Android Studio.
3.  **Build and Run:** Sync Gradle if prompted, then build and run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device. Ensure the device has speech recognition and Text-to-Speech capabilities enabled.
